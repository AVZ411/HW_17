                <h1>Who is Anna Z?</h1>
                <h3>Anna is an eclectic, process-oriented, inspired website and mobile designer. She is task-focused and
                    results-driven. When Anna is presented with a challenge, she thrives on discovering solutions.
                    
                    <h2>
                    How long has Anna been a problem solver and a designer?    
                    </h2>
                    
                    <h3> Anna obtained her bachelors degree in Finance and International Business and held client facing
                    roles within large financial institutions. She also obtained a Masters degree in Accounting and
                    joined a Financial Regulatory Organization. While working in the financial sectors, she became known
                    to her management, colleagues, and clients as someone who will get to the bottom of any problem that
                    she is being presented with. She earned a reputation as someone who clients trusted to know that she
                    will do what is best for them.

                    Anna began her career in website design and usability totally out of frustration. She was reviewing
                    a web-product for work and became frustrated that it was not user friendly and intuitive. She also
                    identified a number of bugs. Since the team did not have the resources, she decided to learn
                    everything she could in order to assist her colleagues in releasing the most lovable product (MLP).</h3>
                    <h2>
                    What are Anna's superstengths? </h2>
                    
                    
                    <h3>
                        Due to Annaâ€™s educational and professional background, as well as the ability to learn new information, Anna is able to identify gaps and propose solutions. She thinks on her feet and experiments in order to ensure that the proposed solution is the best one to meet the needs.  
                </h3>
                
                
                   <h2>
                    Does Anna have any weaknesses?</h2>
                               
                    <h3>
                        She will be the first to admit that she does not have art background which can be useful when creating business does not have an image designer. However, she has discovered that even without it, she is still able to deliver high-quality and engaging web-products.</h3>  
                </h3>
                <h1>
                    So, why hire Anna to complete your project?
                </h1>
                <h3>
                    Her boss nicknamed her an 'idea-generator', another boss used to tell external clients that 
                    she is like a pitbull with a bone - once she starts on something she has to finish it and do it right. 
                    She has a very diverse professional and educational background that gives her the ability to not only 
                    be able to understand the technical side, but also the needs of a business, and clients.
